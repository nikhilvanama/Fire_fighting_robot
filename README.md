ðŸ¤–  IoT Firefighting Robot Project

Our IoT Firefighting Robot Project represents a pioneering approach to fire incident management. In the face of a fire emergency, this innovative robot takes charge. It's designed to operate in high-heat environments, executing critical tasks like fire suppression and data collection, all while keeping human responders safe. Our project leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), equipping the robot with real-time sensors and advanced algorithms, ensuring swift and precise fire combat. Join us in shaping the future of firefighting technology and safety. For more details, check out the project's documentation and code.
